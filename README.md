Data and code supporting the paper **Considering Public Transit:  New Insights into job and food access for low-income residents in Baltimore, Md** by Plano, Darby, and Jadud.

We completed a transit access analysis using transportation analysis zones and travel time via public transit between zones across Baltimore City and County, MD. We determined the number of healthy food stores, or supermarkets, and employment opportunities accessible from a particular origin zone for all zones in the metropolitan area.
