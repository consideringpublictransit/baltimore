'''
1.	Added columns JobDensRating and FoodDensRating and AccessRate to output jobs-within-30
2.	Deleted all TAZs not in study area
a.	Study area TAZs are 1-217 and 426-767 (218-425 inclusive are missing)
3.	Rated food dens on six point scale with no outlier issues (details in spreadsheet)
(Six equal ranges from min to max.)
4.	Rated emp dens on six point scale with no outlier issues (details in spreadsheet)
(Same... take total range and divide by six.)
5.	Combined scale of 12 points by adding two separate scales together 
6.	Selected those TAZs rated 2 or 3 in overall access rating 
7.	Selected only the low income TAZs from that selection (under 185% of poverty level for 2.6 people which is $31,105.90)

GOAL: Output a sheet like 2&3 LowInc. This would then be merged in a spatial GIS package. A CSV is just fine.
